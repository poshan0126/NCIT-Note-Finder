**********************************************
Note Finder - NCIT, Pokhara University :books:
**********************************************

Requirement Analysis
====================
It is quite obvious for Learners to search for study materials and resources to aid in their studies.

Time to time, I had found myself searching for study materials, googling in a hope to find related materials. Sadly, I have to say that there are no good sources which will provide students with good quality subject materials either free of cost or in any way.


How will I build Note Finder?
==============================
Using my Knowledge in Python, Django, Bootstrap, JS, and other Engineering Hacks, I will prepare a web app which will allow users to download or upload study materials with a less pain and more satisfaction.

All the notes will be stored in a Database and All the notes are meant to be licensed under Creative Commons license.

Minimum Specification
=====================
1. Any user can search for the study materials or filter their way to the study materials using the search form and/or filter buttons.
2. Any interested users can upload the study materials of related subjects using a web-form uploader.
   

Advance Specification(Not Sure)
===============================
1. A User Profile Section. Any user can freely register and create an account to manage their notes and study materials. After creating an account they can bookmark the notes So that they will have to suffer less when they delete the notes from their local Device.
